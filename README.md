# todoFirebase
Hello, 
This is a Todo App which is using Firebase as a db to store data about lists.
I have added Firebase Authentication to enable multiple users sign up and use this database simultaneously.
The app is created in React using React Router, Typescript and Hooks.
Feel free to jump in and create Your todo list and let me know what do You think :)
